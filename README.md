# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution

## Overview

- This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.18+, v16+ to run.

- Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

### What I learned

- I learned to use the useContext hook in order to implement the theme switcher of the app
- I also had to learn routing so as to see the detailed information on a seperate page without refreshing the home page
